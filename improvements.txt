-I think there could be a requirement that could involve a DELETE operation of
an entity. This would give an opportunity to test the personal knowledge of the
candidate for SQL and for knowledge of REST, as the other parts of this assignment
can be easily derived from previous code.

-There could be more SQL operations put into the project. A couple of more
complex statements or a requirement related to creating triggers or tables could
help with allowing candidates to show their skills.

-The packaging and other relevant files were easy to work with, it was pretty
easy to delve straight into the project. The documentation was clear and easy to
understand.

- I decided to leave generic messages for the error handling instead of if I
were actually writing it, many of the errors would simply return a 404 status.
I used it as an opportunity to triple check the locations of the corresponding
errors with each related issue.

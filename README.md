# Elecex Coding Challenge 1

## This challenge is intended to assess your coding ability in NodeJS.

- You should not spend more than 2.5 - 3 hours on implementing the requirements. (If you wish to you can, but we understand that people have busy lives)
- The requirements are split into _Essential_ and _Optional_. Only solutions with all essential requirements complete will be considered. You can implement as many of the optional requirements as you wish.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS Installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Available Commands

From the root directory there are a few commands that you can run
- _npm start_ - Run the project
- _npm run test_ - Run the test suite.

## Project Background

This project contains the beginnings of a rather simple REST api.

It consists of an SQLite database with two tables (Sites, Devices), and a simple webserver that currently exposes three endpoints.

You will be expected to implement some new functionality, and ensure this new functionality is tested.
